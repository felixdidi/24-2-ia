38960	39960	You just give them cuddles.
39960	41960	I give them actual caretaking.
41960	43960	Excuse me, I take care of my angel.
43960	45960	That's why she loves me more than you.
45960	46960	No.
46960	47960	I can't breathe.
47960	49960	I don't care what any animal it is.
49960	50960	I don't care if it's a worm.
50960	51960	I don't care what it is.
51960	54960	I don't care what it is.
54960	57960	But I am in first.

133400	134400	Fish!
134400	136400	It's an aquarium!
139400	141400	We got an aquarium, but where's the fish?
141400	146400	You can actually buy the fish because you need to acclimate the water first.
146880	147880	Okay.
148880	151880	You can choose whatever fish you want.
151880	153880	At least you already have a set up.
153880	154880	Thank you!
154880	155880	This thing looks so high tech.
