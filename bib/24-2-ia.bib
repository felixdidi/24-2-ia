  abstract = {Computational text analysis (CTA) comprises techniques for measuring the content of texts with the help of computer algorithms. The methods are discussed under various labels, such as text-as-data, automated content analysis, natural language processing, or text mining. The defining characteristic of a CTA technique is that once it is initially configured, the computational system performs the measurements independently without requiring any manual intervention or effort. The strength of CTA lies in its scalability, enabling the measurement of characteristics across vast amounts of text. As a result, CTA has seen widespread application in communication, related social sciences, and the digital humanities, with the increasing availability of digital or digitized, machine-readable texts. We start this chapter with an overview of the historical development of CTA. We then systematize CTA along two dimensions: the representations of texts for the computational analysis and the supervision of the measurement process. While doing so, we provide some examples of popular techniques. The chapter ends with an outlook into the near future.},

  abstract = {The current study investigates parasocial relationships as the underlying mechanism explaining prejudice reduction following extended exposure to mediated outgroups. Heterosexual participants viewed a fictional television series for 10 weeks depicting outgroup (gay) characters in which the outgroup attribute (sexuality) was accentuated or sanitized. Parasocial relationships with outgroup characters grew significantly over the course of the study regardless of condition. White participants and participants who reported the strongest pretest prejudice experienced the most intense growth. Outgroup prejudice decreased significantly over time for participants in both experimental conditions. Parasocial relationships predicted both prejudice reduction over time and behavioral responses to the outgroup. Parasocial relationships with an ingroup character engaged in intergroup contact did not contribute to prejudice reduction beyond parasocial relationships with outgroup characters. This research suggests that audiences can develop socioemotional bonds with outgroup television characters that can influence attitudes and behaviors much the same as direct, interpersonal intergroup contact.},

Against the background of general theories about time, process, and measurement, an entertainment process is conceptualized as a set of characteristic sequences of intelligibly connected events based on specific rules and parameters of time. These characteristic events could be seen as entertainment experiences themselves, but they also contribute to a final evaluation after media exposure. Although most communication scholars concur that entertainment has processual aspects and therefore measure responses or experiences during exposure, a perspective on the process as a whole (i.e., its time dependency and consequences) is rarely investigated. Therefore, the process perspective is analyzed using a number of entertainment theories. This research posits that entertainment theories as well as the measurement of entertainment processes could benefit from a more detailed exposition about the theoretical assumptions on the shape of a process.},

Causes and outcomes of parasocial interaction experience are examined. To this end, a new Experience of Parasocial Interaction (EPSI) scale is introduced. In a 2 (Bodily Addressing) × 2 (Verbal Addressing) between-subjects experiment (N = 198) viewers reported a more intense parasocial experience if they were addressed by a TV performer on a bodily and verbal level. In addition, the more viewers perceived the performer to be attractive and the stronger their perspective-taking ability, the more intense their parasocial experience. Stronger parasocial experience resulted in higher commitment to social norms and a greater enjoyment of the exposure situation.},

This has often been associated with the terms “big data” and “computational social science.” Using such data, social scientists have argued, will enable us to better understand social, political, and economic life. Yet this new data type comes not only with promises but with challenges as well. These include developing standards for data collection, preparation, analysis, and reporting; establishing more systematic links between established theories within the existing body of research in the social sciences; and moving away from proofs-of-concepts toward the systematic development and testing of hypotheses. In this article, we map these promises and challenges in detail and introduce five highly innovative contributions collected in this special issue. These articles illustrate impressively the potential of digital trace data in the social science all the while remaining conscious of its pitfalls.},

Unlike traditional parasocial research, this study employed natural language processing to score streamer-targeted and viewer-targeted messages for verbal immediacy. It divided chat data according to stream content and streamer type and found that streamer-targeted messages consistently scored higher in verbal immediacy than viewer-targeted messages. The verbal immediacy scores for this dataset were content-agnostic. The findings illustrated a new method for testing the perceived relational closeness of parasocial relationships, namely, utilizing user-generated content to identify verbal indicators of parasocial relationships. Researchers are now capable of exploring the variance of parasocial relationships as they are naturally presented through new media platforms, where media users and figures co-exist.},

Specifically, the predictors of parasocial interactions (PSIs) and parasocial relationships (PSRs) were compared. In the past, the terms ‘parasocial interaction’ and ‘parasocial relationship’ have been used interchangeably, even though they are distinct constructs – which has confused researchers’ understanding of these phenomena. The current study aims to begin to disentangle our understanding of these two constructs by studying the predictors for each construct separately. An online survey was utilized to collect data on PSRs, PSIs, and various parasocial predictors that fell into three categories: streamer (source) characteristics, viewer characteristics, and behavioral (relationship) characteristics. Results indicate that streamer characteristics were the most important predictors of both PSIs and PSRs in the live streaming context, although characteristics of the viewer and relationship were also influential. These findings indicate that message sources can modify their content to encourage parasocial phenomena in their audience. This is encouraging, as research suggests that parasocial phenomena lead to many positive repercussions for the media and so are generally considered a goal of media personae.},

Research on this topic has accumulated rapidly, accompanied by controversial public debate and numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Yet, a higher-level integration of the multiple disparate conceptual and operational approaches to CMC and MH and individual review findings is desperately needed. To this end, we first develop two organizing frameworks that systematize conceptual and operational approaches to CMC and MH. Based on these frameworks, we integrate the literature through a meta-review of 34 reviews and a content analysis of 594 publications. Meta-analytic evidence, overall, suggests a small negative association between social media use and MH. However, effects are complex and depend on the CMC and MH indicators investigated. Based on our conceptual review and the evidence synthesis, we devise an agenda for future research in this interdisciplinary field.},

However, researchers are often faced with extensive challenges when they try to access these "big communication data." These restrictions prevent scientific exploration and the application of new computational methods and, thus, ultimately constrain the development of the field of computational communication science (CCS). As a first step to improve scientific access to large communication data, this article systematizes the data acquisition options and outlines their specific advantages and barriers based on a qualitative interview study with 22 researchers in the field of CCS. Three overarching themes are identified that seem to determine the resulting data quality of all data collection methods. On the basis of these findings, we develop an agenda on how communication science could overcome the challenges of accessing large data sets in the future.},

This extensive advertising strategy has led to an increase in votes for populist parties/politicians and in membership numbers for extremist groups. Although there are speculations in media reports that the simple worldview created by populists contributes to more extreme positions, no study tested whether extremists rely on populist communication in their communiqués. The current study therefore investigated whether populist communication styles are present in extremist propaganda. A quantitative content analysis on N=51 extremist YouTube videos (n=25 right-wing extremist,n=26 Islamist extremist) was conducted to analyze potential differences between ideologies. The results demonstrate that 30\% of videos display all three elements of populism (people centrism, anti-elitism and restoration of sovereignty). However, multilevel analysis revealed only small differences between ideologies regarding the use of populist communication. The discussion will focus on implications of populist communication in extremist videos and potential prevention strategies.},

These techniques may be used to study individuals, groups, cultures, or historical periods by means of either qualitative or quantitative research. This chapter indicates that an acceptable level of reliability is often attainable for content-analytic or narrative measures and that such measures not only can possess construct validity and predictive validity, but may be the best available measures according to these criteria.

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era of text annotation, as their ease-of-use, high accuracy, and relatively low costs have meant that their use has exploded in recent months. However, the rapid growth of the field has meant that LLM-based annotation has become something of an academic Wild West: the lack of established practices and standards has led to concerns about the quality and validity of research. Researchers have warned that the ostensible simplicity of LLMs can be misleading, as they are prone to bias, misunderstandings, and unreliable results. Recognizing the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper proposes a comprehensive set of standards and best practices for their reliable, reproducible, and ethical use. These guidelines span critical areas such as model selection, prompt engineering, structured prompting, prompt stability analysis, rigorous model validation, and the consideration of ethical and legal implications. The paper emphasizes the need for a structured, directed, and formalized approach to using LLMs, aiming to ensure the integrity and robustness of text annotation practices, and advocates for a nuanced and critical engagement with LLMs in social scientific research.},

As LLMs are easy-to-use, cheap, fast, and applicable on a broad range of text analysis tasks, ranging from text annotation and classification to sentiment analysis and critical discourse analysis, many scholars believe that LLMs will transform how we do text analysis. This how-to guide is aimed at students and researchers with limited programming experience, and offers a simple introduction to how LLMs can be used for text analysis in your own research project, as well as advice on best practices. We will go through each of the steps of analyzing textual data with LLMs using Python: installing the software, setting up the API, loading the data, developing an analysis prompt, analyzing the text, and validating the results. As an illustrative example, we will use the challenging task of identifying populism in political texts, and show how LLMs move beyond the existing state-of-the-art.},

Through synthesis of research across disciplines, the model conceptualizes the relational goals and parasocial interactions (PSIs) specific to the PSR. The model identifies variables that predict engagement at that level, describes the stage’s outcomes/effects, and considers the utility of existing measures to assess these stages. The conceptualization of PSRs as a dynamic process rather than intensity of a monolithic experience offers new directions worthy of empirical examination.},

However, by nature, relationships evolve over time and need to be managed and nurtured if they are to thrive. The chapter offers an account of the key predictors in the initiation and evolution of positive, amicable PSRs. This chapter addresses the dynamic nature of PSRs by providing an overview of the literature concerning factors that predict the initiation and continued growth of PSRs. The chapter then turns to describe three theoretical models that conceptualize PSRs as an ever-evolving process. The chapter concludes by highlighting several promising areas for future research into the initiation and development of PSRs.},
